        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This sirloin steak recipe is served with very garlicky butter that makes this steak <br>
            melt-in-your-mouth wonderful! I have never tasted any other steak that came 
            <br>even close to this recipe. If you are having steak, don't skimp on flavor to save a
            <br> few calories.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>Â½ cup butter</li> 

            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            
            <li>4 pounds beef top sirloin steaks</li>
            
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Direction</h2>
<ol>
    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; stir in minced garlic and garlic powder. Set aside.</li>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
<li>Season both sides of each steak with salt and pepper.</li>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<li>Place steaks on preheated grill and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness.</li>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
<li>Transfer steaks to warmed plates; brush the tops liberally with garlic butter and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.</li>
</ol>
